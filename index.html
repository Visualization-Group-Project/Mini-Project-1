              This visualization is for those interested in comparing the
              different disease deaths worldwide
            </li>
            <li>
              This visualization is trying to show the seriousness of the
              coronavirus outbreak
            </li>
            <li>
              The data being encoded in this visualization is the average
              disease deaths per day worldwide by different pandemics and
              endemics
            </li>
            <li>
              The data is encoded as a horizontal bar chart with its x-axis
              representing the number of average disease deaths and y-axis
              representing the type of disease. The seriousness of COVID-19 is
              emphasized through being highlighted in a different color
            </li>
            <li>
              The reader is tasked with comparing the values of the total deaths
              and identifying the upper extreme
            </li>
            <li>
              This visualization is particularly insightful and enlightening
              with its use of color and the clear format of the bar chart. The
              bars are colored in blue except for COVID-19, allowing the
              audience to easily notice that the average disease deaths for the
              coronavirus is the highest. The bars are also sorted in the order
              of highest to lowest number of deaths, displaying the most
              important information on the top. To help with further comparison,
              each type of disease is categorized into either “pandemic” or
              “endemic” with different colors. It is also truthful since the
              scaling is also to standard with the numbers labeled at the tip of
              each bar for clarity. This visualization certainly helps the
              audience interpret visualization correctly, making it functional
              as well. It is fairly average in terms of beauty
            </li>
            <li>
              Considering all aspects, this visualization is good because it is
              very approachable and easy to understand. It has great
              quantitative measures and a clear comparison that the audience can
              see and figure out what is important. The use of colors are very
              effective and practical as well.

        Bad Visualization 1
        <div class="column">

            This visualization is for the readers of technical papers who are
            interested in the changing data on email usages
          </li>
          <li>
            This plot is trying to convey that email traffic is steeply on the
            rise
          </li>
          <li>
            The data being encoded in this visualization is the total worldwide
            emails being used per day, in billions, through 2017 to 2021
          </li>
          <li>
            The data is represented through a barchart. The x-axis represents
            years and the y-axis shows the total worldwide emails (billions).
            The bars have different colors that illustrate respective years
          </li>
          <li>
            The reader is tasked with identifying the different number of total
            emails for the years shown, recognizing the trend by comparing those
            numbers
          </li>
          <li>
            Although unnecessary, this visualization can be seen as beautiful
            with a pleasing combination of colors. However, it fails to apply
            the other four principles. The plot unfairly represents the data:
            the y-axis does not start at 0 but starts at a very large value of
            225 billion instead. In addition, the time range is very narrow and
            includes years that need prediction of the future, not using data
            that is collected. The form of the barchart also has needless
            features such as 3D and the shadows. Thus this visualization does
            not have the qualities of being truthful, functional, insightful,
            and enlightening
          </li>
          <li>
            Considering all aspects, this visualization is bad because it can be
            misleading to its audience. It not only has unnecessary design
            features, but also misrepresents the data. The bar chart shows a
            trend with some predictions of the future that could not necessarily
            be accurate information, and has incorrect scaling that makes the
            chart seem like email traffic has doubled when it only went by a
            small fraction in truth.
