              This visualization is particularly insightful and enlightening
              with its use of color and the clear format of the bar chart. The
              bars are colored in blue except for COVID-19, allowing the
              audience to easily notice that the average disease deaths for the
              coronavirus is the highest. The bars are also sorted in the order
              of highest to lowest number of deaths, displaying the most
              important information on the top. To help with further comparison,
              each type of disease is categorized into either “pandemic” or
              “endemic” with different colors. It is also truthful since the
              scaling is also to standard with the numbers labeled at the tip of
              each bar for clarity. This visualization certainly helps the
              audience interpret visualization correctly, making it functional
              as well. It is fairly average in terms of beauty

              Considering all aspects, this visualization is good because it is

              quantitative measures and a clear comparison that the audience can
              see and figure out what is important. The use of colors are very
              effective and practical as well.

            This visualization is for the readers of technical papers who are
            interested in the changing data on email usages
          </li>
          <li>
            This plot is trying to convey that email traffic is steeply on the
            rise
          </li>
          <li>
            The data being encoded in this visualization is the total worldwide
            emails being used per day, in billions, through 2017 to 2021
          </li>
          <li>
            The data is represented through a barchart. The x-axis represents
            years and the y-axis shows the total worldwide emails (billions).
            The bars have different colors that illustrate respective years
          </li>
          <li>
            The reader is tasked with identifying the different number of total
            emails for the years shown, recognizing the trend by comparing those
            numbers
          </li>
          <li>
            Although unnecessary, this visualization can be seen as beautiful
            with a pleasing combination of colors. However, it fails to apply
            the other four principles. The plot unfairly represents the data:
            the y-axis does not start at 0 but starts at a very large value of
            225 billion instead. In addition, the time range is very narrow and
            includes years that need prediction of the future, not using data
            that is collected. The form of the barchart also has needless
            features such as 3D and the shadows. Thus this visualization does
            not have the qualities of being truthful, functional, insightful,
            and enlightening
          </li>
          <li>
            Considering all aspects, this visualization is bad because it can be
            misleading to its audience. It not only has unnecessary design
            features, but also misrepresents the data. The bar chart shows a
            trend with some predictions of the future that could not necessarily
            be accurate information, and has incorrect scaling that makes the
            chart seem like email traffic has doubled when it only went by a
            small fraction in truth.

      <h3>Best Redesign</h3>

            The biggest problem of the previous visualization was that it did
            not have correct scaling and that there were predicted data. Also,
            the whole purpose of the visualization was to show that the number
            of daily emails is on the rise. To address these problems, I created
            a line graph that clearly shows the rising trend. The number of
            emails each year is labeled, and the y-axis starts at 0 to prevent
            any misguidance of the scale. I was able to find the actual dataset
            that the visualization was made of, so I included more years for
            better comparison, and put a * mark next to the years that have
            predicted data instead of collected ones. This captures the rising
            trend at once and allows the viewers to compare the values across
            years with the labeled values on top of each dots. A trade-off of
            using a line graph instead of a bar chart would be that it
            emphasizes more on the general trend than the individual values, so
            it would be less appropriate when the purpose is to compare each
            value per year.

              This visualization is truthful as it shows the correct stock data
              and the graph is scaled equally. It is functional as the readers
              can easily identify the changes in time through both the graph and
              heatmap. It is beautiful as its scale is near to 45%. It is
              insightful and enlightening as it shows historical evidence to
              support the author’s claim.

              Considering all aspects, this visualization is good because it is
              easy to understand with minimal data encoding. Both x-axis and
              y-axis are uniformly scaled to prevent misleading perception. It

            To a certain extent, this visualization is beautiful as the graph
            can easily gain the audience's attention. However, the visualization
            fails in other categories. The y axis of the graph is scaled
            unevenly, creating misperception over COVID-19 cases. Uneven marks
            in the x axis also makes the viewer hard to grasp the average change
            over time. Lastly, the data is ambiguous as it could be either
            cumulative or discrete.
          </li>

            Considering all aspects, this visualization is bad because it fails

            Here I used Line graph as a design choice. I encoded dates in x-axis
            and the number of COVID 19 cases in y-axis . Although the redesign
            shares the same design choice, it differs as it has correct scaling
            over both y-axis and x-axis. With correct scaling, the redesign
            improves upon the original by providing accurate representation of
            data trends in the graph. As there is a lack of consistent data, the
            connecting lines between the labels could be misleading. However, as
            the visualization’s main purpose is to show the trend, I believe
            line chart is the best option in this circumstance.

            The data being encoded in this visualization is two sets of five

            Also it can be enlightening as it can encourage Baby Boomers to
            overcome the stereotypes or acknowledge how HR professionals
            perceive them. However, the visualization fails in other categories.
            The visualization is misleading since the percentages of the left
            chart add up to 243% and the right 162%. The colored distributions
            are not in proportion as well; looking at the colored proportions on
            the right, it is hard to discern the size of people-savvy and
            creative, which have 23% differences. Also, the leadership trait on
            the left side covers the whole head at 40%, while the right side
