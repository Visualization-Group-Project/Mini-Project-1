      <div class="row">

              This visualization is for those interested in comparing the
              different disease deaths worldwide
            </li>
            <li>
              This visualization is trying to show the seriousness of the
              coronavirus outbreak
            </li>
            <li>
              The data being encoded in this visualization is the average
              disease deaths per day worldwide by different pandemics and
              endemics
            </li>
            <li>
              The data is encoded as a horizontal bar chart with its x-axis
              representing the number of average disease deaths and y-axis
              representing the type of disease. The seriousness of COVID-19 is
              emphasized through being highlighted in a different color
            </li>
            <li>
              The reader is tasked with comparing the values of the total deaths
              and identifying the upper extreme
            </li>
            <li>
              This visualization is particularly insightful and enlightening
              with its use of color and the clear format of the bar chart. The
              bars are colored in blue except for COVID-19, allowing the
              audience to easily notice that the average disease deaths for the
              coronavirus is the highest. The bars are also sorted in the order
              of highest to lowest number of deaths, displaying the most
              important information on the top. To help with further comparison,
              each type of disease is categorized into either “pandemic” or
              “endemic” with different colors. It is also truthful since the
              scaling is also to standard with the numbers labeled at the tip of
              each bar for clarity. This visualization certainly helps the
              audience interpret visualization correctly, making it functional
              as well. It is fairly average in terms of beauty
            </li>
            <li>
              Considering all aspects, this visualization is good because it is
              very approachable and easy to understand. It has great
              quantitative measures and a clear comparison that the audience can
              see and figure out what is important. The use of colors are very
              effective and practical as well.

      <h3>Bad Visualization 1</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">

        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <li>
            This visualization is for the readers of technical papers who are
            interested in the changing data on email usages
          </li>
          <li>
            This plot is trying to convey that email traffic is steeply on the
            rise
          </li>
          <li>
            The data being encoded in this visualization is the total worldwide
            emails being used per day, in billions, through 2017 to 2021
          </li>
          <li>
            The data is represented through a barchart. The x-axis represents
            years and the y-axis shows the total worldwide emails (billions).
            The bars have different colors that illustrate respective years
          </li>
          <li>
            The reader is tasked with identifying the different number of total
            emails for the years shown, recognizing the trend by comparing those
            numbers
          </li>
          <li>
            Although unnecessary, this visualization can be seen as beautiful
            with a pleasing combination of colors. However, it fails to apply
            the other four principles. The plot unfairly represents the data:
            the y-axis does not start at 0 but starts at a very large value of
            225 billion instead. In addition, the time range is very narrow and
            includes years that need prediction of the future, not using data
            that is collected. The form of the barchart also has needless
            features such as 3D and the shadows. Thus this visualization does
            not have the qualities of being truthful, functional, insightful,
            and enlightening
          </li>
          <li>
            Considering all aspects, this visualization is bad because it can be
            misleading to its audience. It not only has unnecessary design
            features, but also misrepresents the data. The bar chart shows a
            trend with some predictions of the future that could not necessarily
            be accurate information, and has incorrect scaling that makes the
            chart seem like email traffic has doubled when it only went by a
            small fraction in truth.
          </li>

      <h3>Best Redesign</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">

        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            The biggest problem of the previous visualization was that it did
            not have correct scaling and that there were predicted data. Also,
            the whole purpose of the visualization was to show that the number
            of daily emails is on the rise. To address these problems, I created
            a line graph that clearly shows the rising trend. The number of
            emails each year is labeled, and the y-axis starts at 0 to prevent
            any misguidance of the scale. I was able to find the actual dataset
            that the visualization was made of, so I included more years for
            better comparison, and put a * mark next to the years that have
            predicted data instead of collected ones. This captures the rising
            trend at once and allows the viewers to compare the values across
            years with the labeled values on top of each dots. A trade-off of
            using a line graph instead of a bar chart would be that it
            emphasizes more on the general trend than the individual values, so
            it would be less appropriate when the purpose is to compare each
            value per year.

              This visualization is for those interested in comparing stock
              performance between growth index and value index for the last 20
              years
            </li>
            <li>
              This visualization demonstrates strong outperformance of growth
              index over value index for the last 10 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              The data being encoded in this visualization is the stock index
              for each sector at given time of the year
            </li>
            <li>
              The visualization encodes the data as a graph with its x-axis
              representing the time (year) and y-axis representing the stock
              index. There is also a horizontal heatmap below the graph
              demonstrating the dominant index of that time by color
            </li>
            <li>
              Here, the reader compares values and see the trends on the graph
            </li>
            <li>
              This visualization is truthful as it shows the correct stock data
              and the graph is scaled equally. It is functional as the readers
              can easily identify the changes in time through both the graph and
              heatmap. It is beautiful as its scale is near to 45%. It is
              insightful and enlightening as it shows historical evidence to
              support the author’s claim.
            </li>
            <li>
              Considering all aspects, this visualization is good because it is
              easy to understand with minimal data encoding. Both x-axis and
              y-axis are uniformly scaled to prevent misleading perception. It
              has great quantitative measures and a clear comparison that the
              audience can see

            The data being encoded in this visualization is the number of

          <li>
            The data is represented through a graph. The x-axis represents the

            The reader is tasked with seeing COVID 19 cases trend in Seattle
            from February to April
          </li>
          <li>
            To a certain extent, this visualization is beautiful as the graph
            can easily gain the audience's attention. However, the visualization
            fails in other categories. The y axis of the graph is scaled
            unevenly, creating misperception over COVID-19 cases. Uneven marks
            in the x axis also makes the viewer hard to grasp the average change
            over time. Lastly, the data is ambiguous as it could be either
            cumulative or discrete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Considering all aspects, this visualization is bad because it fails
            to deliver a clear message to its viewers. The explanation over data
            is unclear, and multiple design issues can delude confusion to its
            viewers.

      <h3>Best Redesign</h3>

            Here I used Line graph as a design choice. I encoded dates in x-axis
            and the number of COVID 19 cases in y-axis . Although the redesign
            shares the same design choice, it differs as it has correct scaling
            over both y-axis and x-axis. With correct scaling, the redesign
            improves upon the original by providing accurate representation of
            data trends in the graph. As there is a lack of consistent data, the
            connecting lines between the labels could be misleading. However, as
            the visualization’s main purpose is to show the trend, I believe
            line chart is the best option in this circumstance.
